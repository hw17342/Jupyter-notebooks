    "# Assignment 2 - Differential Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving partial differential equations is crucial to a huge variety of physical problems encountered in science and engineering. There are many different numerical techniques available, all with their own advantages and disadvantages, and often specific problems are best solved with very specific algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will have learnt about Euler and Runge-Kutta methods in 2nd year lectures, and you should have explored the class of problem that can be solved with numerical integration in exercises.  In this assignment, we will cover more complex classes of problem - described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Initial value problems\n",
    "\n",
    "In this class of problem, the state of a system is fully described by an ordinary differential equation together with an initial condition.  For example, the motion of a body under gravity, with initial conditions given by the position and momentum of the body at a particular point in time.  The soluiton (ie. position and momentum at an arbitrary time in the future) can then be found by integration.  You should have encountered the use of numerical integration in solving such problems in the 2nd year course.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Boundary value problems\n",
    "\n",
    "Boundary value problems differ in that the conditions are specified on a set of boundaries, rather than at just one extreme.  For example, the electric field between a pair of capacitor plates at fixed potential, as discussed in the problem below.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several numerical approaches for solving boundary value problems, for example :\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shooting Method\n",
    "\n",
    "In this method, the boundary value problem is reduced to an initial value problem, which is solved numerically for different parameter choices. A solution is found when a set of parameters give the desired boundary conditions.  For example, finding a rocket trajectory which joins two specified points in space.  The boundary conditions are the specified points, and the initial momentum is a parameter that may be varied until a solution is found.  (This should sound familiar!)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finite Difference Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "In this class of method, the differential equation is evaluated at discrete points in space and time, and derivatives are approximated by finite differences.  The Euler and Runga-Kutta methods are simple examples.  These methods typically involve iteration on the set of finite values until a solution is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relaxation\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a common technique used to solve time-independent boundary condition problems.  An initial guess at the solution is supplied, and then allow to \"relax\" by iterating towards the final solution.  Conceptually this is is the same as the time-dependent problem of letting the system reach equilibrium from some arbitrary initial state.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps for implementing a relaxation method are :\n",
    "1. Define a (normally regular) spatial grid covering the region of interest including points (or “nodes”) on the boundaries\n",
    "2. Impose the boundary conditions by fixing the nodes on the boundaries to the relevant values\n",
    "3. Set all non-boundary nodes to an initial guess\n",
    "4. Write down finite difference equations\n",
    "5. Pick a convergence criterion\n",
    "6. Iterate the equations at each node until the solution converges\n",
    "\n",
    "Care must be taken to choose the form of the equations and iteration method to ensure stability and efficiency."

    "## Q1 - The Poisson Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the example of the Poisson equation $(\\nabla^2V = −\\rho)$ in one dimension. The grid of nodes in this case can be taken as a series of $n$ equally spaced points $x_i$ with a spacing $\\Delta x = h$. The Taylor expansion of $V$ around the point $x_i$ is :\n",

    "In the absence of any sources ($\\nabla^2 V=0$, i.e. the Laplace equation) each node is simply the average of its four closest neighbours.\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation can be solved in a number of ways. One option is to calculate a new value for each node based on the previous values for each of the neighbour nodes,  requiring two complete copies of the grid. This is called the Jacobi method. A second option is to update the values on the grid continually, so each node is updated using partially old and partially new values. This is the Gauss-Seidel method."
