    "In the first three lectures of the Classical I: Mechanics and Thermal Physics course we considered the case of coupled oscillators. As you will have realised from the lectures, the full solution to these problems often entails tedious matrix calculations (finding determinants etc.) that are very prone to simple errors in calculation. In practise computers are veryy good at handling these linear algebra problems. The idea of this work book is that you should begin to appreciate the physics of the solutions to the problem and what they mean, without getting bogged down in calculation. This said, you should make sure that you are able to solve eigenvalue/eigenvector problems for simple 2 or 3 particle coupled systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we move on let's consider the general scheme for approaching these problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, from the description of the problem you should be able to recognise it as a question of coupled oscillators. Questions will almost always state that you should consider small oscillations, in which case you can assume the potential will be parabolic. You should be able to demonstrate this by consider a Taylor expansion of any sensible 'bowl' like potential. Typical examples might be springs, coupled pendulums, coupled LCR circuits or even the interatomic potentials between atoms.  \n",

    "For our typical mechanics questions it is the solution for the position of the masses as a function of time that we seek.(Coupled LCR circuits will be discussed separately). \n",

    "In the previous examples the masses were attached to fixed walls by springs (Dirichlet boundary conditions). Modify the code above (reproduced below) to consider the case when the masses at the ends are not connected to a wall but are allowed to float freely. To do this you need to redetermine the equations of motion for the two masses at the end of the chain and modify the first and last rows of the matrix accordingly. Again plot out the eigenvectors. One of the eigenvectors is distinct from the others. Can you explain why it has this form?"

    "In this notebook we have explored the two mass coupled oscillator system covered in lectures and extended the solution to cases where the spring constants are unequal. The case where the masses are different is covered in a different notebook. We have shown how we can treat this as an eigenvalue/eigenvector problem and shown how the soluitions can be calculated using python. We have extended the analysis to chains with $N>>2$ and shown how the solutions may still be calculated with simple function calls in python. "
