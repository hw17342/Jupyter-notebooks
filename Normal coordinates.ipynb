Each of these equations corresponds to a normal mode of the system and we note that they act as independent oscillators in $\\vec{q}$ space. In otherwords if the system is oscillating in the coordinate $q_i$ then no energy will be transfered to the other modes (as the equations are uncoupled). Another way of saying this is we have transformed the problem from being defined in a vector space $\\vec{x}$ to a vector space $\\vec{q}$. You may ask why this might be interesting. It is possible to consider both the kinetic and potential energy in the $\\vec{q}$ coordinates, for example the kinetic energy of each mode may be written as $\\frac{1}{2}M_i q_i^2$ where $M_i$ corresponds to a 'mass' in $\\vec{q}$-space. It is easy to see how the energy might be partitioned in a system when we use these coordinates.

Unfortunately, we cannot cover Lagrangian mechanics and generalised (normal) coordinates here but the method will appear in more advanced courses.\n",
